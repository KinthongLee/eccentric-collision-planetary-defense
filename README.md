This code primarily generates the original code used in the Icarus paper titled "Investigation of the Incremental Benefits of Eccentric Collisions in Kinetic Deflection of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids." It includes all computational models and result processing. Everyone is welcome to use and modify this code! Just remember to reference the paper! If you publish your work, please cite my article! I would greatly appreciate it!

Additionally, I am currently conducting research on asteroid defense at Tsinghua University in China and welcome any potential collaborations! You can reach me at: ktlee3819@gmail.com.
